      <h2>Staatstheather Digitaltheater</h2>
      <p>
        As a working student at the Staatstheater Augsburg in the Digital
Theater department, I was involved in a wide range of creative and
technical tasks. I filmed and produced the intro and outro for Der
Sandmann and supported the production Ekklesia by designing
printed materials and applying textures to 3D models. For Wonderland
Avenue, I edited a documentary video and added various
digital elements.
A major focus of my work was on the production Der Vorgang,
where I was responsible for the digital implementation. Since the
subject matter of this play was particularly important, I valued the
opportunity to contribute creatively and technically to its realization.
In addition to production-related work, I represented the theater
at exhibitions such as ARS Electronica, where I helped present the
productions to visitors and introduced them to VR experiences. I
also supported various performances by assisting the audience in
exploring the digital aspects of the productions.

      <h2>Studio Louter</h2>
      <p>
        „Closer to Memling“ is an immersive experience created by Studio Louter
for the Sint-Janshospitaal (St. John‘s Hospital) in Bruges. It focuses
on Hans Memling‘s masterpieces, which can be experienced up close
through high-resolution digital renderings. Through interactive elements,
lighting, and sound, visitors experience the works in new ways and uncover
details that are hardly visible to the naked eye.
The project is aimed at a broad audience, particularly families and children
from about seven years of age. Workshops, prototype testing, and
user-centered design ensured that the experience was interactive and
accessible.
During my internship, I created sketches and mock-ups for the interior
design. These served both as a visualization for the museum in Bruges
and as a basis for coordinating the final design. This allowed me to actively
contribute to the conception and presentation of the project.

      <h2>Labbinaer</h2>
      <p>
        During my internship at Labbinaer, I was able to gain valuable insights
into the daily work processes and contribute to different projects.
My tasks included supporting the team ,I was mainly responsible
for creating and updating social media content. I filmed and
edited short clips, kept the channels up to date, and supported the
communication of ongoing projects. In addition, I edited video documentation,
which allowed me to strengthen my skills in storytelling
and post-production. Through this experience, I learned how to
work independently and collaboratively in a creative environment,
and I developed both my organizational and communication skills.
